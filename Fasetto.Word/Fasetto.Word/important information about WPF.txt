WPF application run in main thread
only that thread handle ui changes
so if u make new thread and make ui changes on it
it will crash(but u will not see that) so u will see that nothing happen

to see all failers/crashes go to Debug\Windows\Exception Settings
and mark on Common Language Runtime Exceptions

and u can see the threads by run the application in debugging mode and use break point,
go to Debug\Windows\Threads
