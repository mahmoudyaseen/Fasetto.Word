first of all why i use view model?

i want to separate the view(WPF design) from code

so i shouldn't make view model depend on view(page, window)
so i shouldn't have or pass a view(page or element(TextBox)) to view model
if i make that so that view model can't run on any other UI becouse view model is depend on view
that like i made in WindowViewModel, i pass a window in constractor and that is wrong, nut it a specific window so its ok

ok now i need the secure password on passwordbox
i can't bind to a securePassword from PasswordBox directly to command parameter because:
	when the page load i bind the secure password to the command parameter, the password is empty and u will have it
	there is no dependency property to securePassword
	so i can't know if password change becouse it have not the inotify property or dependency property for secure password
	so i only have the empty password(first value when page loaded)


i can't pass the PasswordBox to the command and get the secure password but this view model is depend on view

so i can make the interface called IHavePassword that contain a getter of SecureString
and make the login page implement that interface so this page should implement the getter and make it return it's securePassword from PasswordBox
in view model i know at least the view implement IHavePassword
so i pass a whole page to the command  as parameter, in this command i convert the page to IHavePassword:
	i just need the IHavePassword Part -> and this will not be depend on view becouse this IHavePassword is not bart of WPF
	and get the secureString(password) from the getter that implemented by Login page
that page is not change, when i execute command that call the password getter to get the current paasword
